URI Design

Resource: /customers
GET (read): Get List - Returns List
POST (create): Create Item - Returns New Item
PUT (update): Update Batch / commonly this isn't supported - Returns Status Code Only
DELETE (delete): Error (should never support) - Returns Status Code Only * Error Status Code

Resource: /customers/123
GET (read): Get Item - Returns Item
POST (create): Error (already exists) - Returns Status Code Only * Error Status Code
PUT (update): Update Item - Returns Updated Item
DELETE (delete): Delete Item - Returns Status Code Only

CampsController
/api/camps
/api/camps/atl2016

split out controllers based on resources even if associated
TalksController (associations)
/api/camps/atl2016/talks
/api/camps/atl2016/talks/1

REST defines URIs as resources
- Bug rexceptions exist..
- ... don't be afraid of functional APIs
- dont try to do RPC stuff with it

When?
- For operational needs
- starting batch job
- clear cache
- Avoid for reporting
- Returning data != functional API
